#SHIELD PARRYING:
# Enable/Disable Shield Parrying =======================================================================================
# (ONLY applies to shields in offhand, shields in main hand will continue to function as normal.)
# What it does: When right clicking with a shield, there will be a short window of time where damage taken from entities will be negated.
# There are two different windows of time. When hit during the first window, a "perfect parry" will be performed, negating damage taken and giving buffs for 2 seconds. (Haste, Speed, Regen)
# After the first window ends, the second window will start. When hit during the second window, a "late parry" will be performed, negating damage taken and giving debuffs for 1 second. (Mining Fatigue, Weakness)
# The first window is 4 ticks long, and the second is 6 ticks. (Total 10 ticks where a hit will be parried.)
# When both windows of time pass wthout being hit, continuing to hold down right click will keep holding up the shield (works same as regular shield) until releasing right click or blocking a hit.
# Upon blocking a hit, shield will enter a cooldown of 20 ticks (1 second).
# On a "perfect parry," shield will enter a cooldown of 2 ticks.
# On a "late parry," shield will enter a cooldown of 15 ticks.
#
#Disabled on default.
